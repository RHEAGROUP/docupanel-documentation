# Searches

DocuPanel provides three types of searches 

1. Instant suggested searches
2. Standard searches
3. Page searches



 **Instant suggested searches** : When a user is writing in the search bar, if the textBox contains at least three characters, a search is performed to provide page suggestions. If the text entered corresponds to a part of the name of a page, a popup will appear below the text with a link to the eventual relevant pages.  



**Standard searches** : When a user clicks on the search icon of the search bar, a search is performed in the whole documentation. A page which presents the results is displayed.



**Pages searches** : A user has the possibility to search a word in the actual page. It is possible with the `Ctrl + f` command.
